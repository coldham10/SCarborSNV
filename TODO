output batches to new pileup file and use diff to make sure threy are the same
use (!top) valgrind massif to make sure memory usage doesn't swell
Fix pileup input from file
If pileup not integer multiple of batch size, get core dump
    -Seems only when n > batch_size * max_queue_size
Separate thread for reader?
    -Correct usage of pileup_done flags
Error checking for wromg m value
Proper log-space calculations:
    Refer to pg 7 of "Computing fast and accurate convolutions"
deal with 0 read depth properly...
    - also ! quality reads. Discard? Adjust likelihood values?

Fix possible buffer overflow when reading

/* Possible (LATER) multithread architecture: a worker picks up a batch and processes those 
* loci all the way through DP etc until cross-genome calculations like cell distances need be calculated */
