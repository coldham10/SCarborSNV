FEATURES
Error checking for wromg m value in cmdline
deal with incomplete dist matrix
    remove orphans
    impute based on 10.1186/1471-2105-9-166 (DOI)
    NB if nans in d then r becomes all NaNs and in min_D, all D vals then become NaN which is not < infty


BUGS
data with ! quality too common in test. Is this normal? Reject or use?
Negative branch lengths! For bigtest this is between root and node. If set to 0, P(clonal mutations) = P(SNV) = 0!!
    -Perhaps adjust this root length by having sum(otherlengths)/root length = lambda/mu ??
valgrind uninitialized errors. I'm dubious... they don't show up when compiled on ARM


TESTING
output batches to new pileup file and use diff to make sure threy are the same
use valgrind massif to make sure memory usage doesn't swell
parameters & missing vals
    -in locus_likelihoods.c I set P(X|g) = P_ADO^2... how legit is this?



THREADING
Separate thread for reader?
Possible (LATER) multithread architecture: a worker picks up a batch and processes those all the way to overline(p)


EM
Once called, imputations can be from LOH or ADO. Relative probabilities easy from tree (ADO are independent between cells)
