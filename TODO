FEATURES
Ignore 0 read depths
    -in locus_likelihoods.c I set P(X|g) = P_ADO^2... how legit is this?
        -Seems to give plausible results for P(D|sig), but will need to prove in paper...
        -Empirically, if we have m cells and m-1 are X but 1 is strongly g=2 then posterior distribution should have large tail, not be focused on 0.
        -Even if m is large
Error checking for wromg m value


BUGS
data with ! quality too common in test. Is this normal? Reject or use?
Buffer for reads can overflow (quals should be fine)



TESTING
output batches to new pileup file and use diff to make sure threy are the same
use valgrind massif to make sure memory usage doesn't swell



THREADING
Separate thread for reader?
Possible (LATER) multithread architecture: a worker picks up a batch and processes those all the way to overline(p)


EM
Once called, imputations can be from LOH or ADO. Relative probabilities easy from tree (ADO are independent between cells)
